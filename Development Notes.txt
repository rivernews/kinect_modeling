Goal 2 = 把兩張不同視角拍攝的 kinect 畫面疊在一起
far goal = 這樣我們就可以做後續的 HDR 亮度結合

	// TODO: merge these two images

	keyword.known = ['3D reconstruction',
	'Kinect video input',
	'image and depth']

	keyword.unknown = ['sparse SIFT keypoint matching',

}

// look up the file structure
Most of them are .m matlab files. Also one .cpp file.
// How to use it?
It says "run SiftFu.m in Matlab." in the Princeton page.
Let's try running it, without any modification.
// Error came up when try to run
Ok now we try to debug it.
// Turns out that the filename is local, and we don't have one. Perhaps an exmaple will help; otherwise we need to figure out the input file format.
No, no example for SiftFu. Only one that is similar to it, SUN3Dsfm, just above it in the princeton page.
We will try to figure out input format, based on the matlab source code.
// We reached a milestone. Report it to prof.
